Obviously if she finds no one she will ask each and everyone of you to come and attend classes. Attendance is not taken for any of the classes today.. Better sit and sleep in your home.

12/22/23, 00:25 - Karthik S Dsi: People listen..… mass bunk or no mass bunk… everything comes down to attendance… and speaking about attendance… that depends on the “ teacher” and speaking about teacher…. Some teachers like Nagaraj sir are peaceful about it… but some are not… and that’s because they fear of logical reasoning… such as” what if somthing happens to the student outside the clg and he’s marked present inside the clg”… and that’s a very valid reason to not give attendance for everyone… and coming to canceling the class… they clearly need permission from the principal to do that.. cause obvi!…and also about days like tomorrow….! Teachers also understand that it’s a long weekend… and most of them won’t be coming… but some WILLL BE there that will go to class… we can’t do anything about that… so the teachers also come and take attendance… this is where… the people with low attendance come into picture .. they fear their attendance might go even low… so they attend… if you're bunking you're anyways not worried about your attendance so why bother the people who are?  Hence the best thing is to just let people who want to attend… ATTEND… and who don’t want to attend… DONT ATTEND. 

And also as CRs of the class we do the best to have a common ground for the class …taking in all the people’s interests… and also replying to Rahul… “ charming “ is it ?… please grow up😂 no offence… but respect goes both ways .. we are in 3rd year now… and you still want us to “charm “ teachers for your attendance?
